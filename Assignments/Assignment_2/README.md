This folder contains warmup codes which are:-

    Used to prime number of stars given by user
    Used print * by taking input from user
    Display string based on condition
    used to display same number in multiple of another number
    used to check weather number is even or odd.

To execute these codes I used commands:-

gcc filename.c -o myexe :- to compile

myexe :- to run
